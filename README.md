2. Project Overview

The Meal Suggestion App is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to Provide the user with a meal suggestion depending on what time of day they enter.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.


3. App Purpose and Features

Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to suggest meals based on what time of day you enter. It was created for someone with a busy schedule and wastes no time in helping someone decide quickly on what they should make to eat at certain times of the day. 

Key Features:
- Feature 1: ["EditText, the EditText feature is where the user will input the time of day and is the key function to the app, once typed in the user will be given a suggestion after pressing the enter button"]
- Feature 2: [TextView, the text view feature is where the apps meal suggestion will be displayed, it will also give an error handling message if input is incorrectly entered]
- Feature 3: [Buttons, two buttons have been added into the app and provide the basic function of both clearing the EditText box and Entering the EditTExt box. once the enter button is clicked the app will display a meal suggestion. the clear button will clear the input typed into the EditText box so the user is able to input another time of day]

These features aim to provide a easy and simple lowing user experience.


4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the Meal Suggestion App was based on the following key considerations:

1. User Experience: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. Performance: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.


5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

6. Screenshots and App Demo

*Caption for screenshot 2: [Describe the context, e.g., "The user profile screen where personal information is updated."]*

### Video Demo:
A video showcasing the app's functionality can be viewed here: [YouTube Video Link].
```

Why:
----
- Visuals like screenshots or a video link provide concrete evidence of the app’s functionality. This is an easy way for the reader to see what the app looks like and how it operates.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "Implementing a complex feature like the login system."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```

Why:
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [Another Main activity file - I would have loved to add a second screen to my app to give it more character, and wor on better designs and image, unfortunately I coulnt execute this]
2. **Feature 2**: [For my predefined conditions i would have loved to implement a randomizer that randomly selects a meal suggestion from 3 options, unfortunately i could not execute this ]

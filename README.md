Project Overview 

The Meal Suggestion App is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD subject. This application was created using Kotlin and Android Studio. The app's primary purpose is to Provide the user with a meal suggestion depending on what time of day they enter. 

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions. 

App Purpose and Features 

Purpose: The main goal of this app is to suggest meals based on what time of day you enter. It was created for someone with a busy schedule and wastes no time in helping someone decide quickly on what they should make to eat at certain times of the day.  

Key Features: 

Feature 1: ["EditText, the EditText feature is where the user will input the time of day and is the key function to the app, once typed in the user will be given a suggestion after pressing the enter button"] 

Feature 2: [TextView, the text view feature is where the apps meal suggestion will be displayed, it will also give an error handling message if input is incorrectly entered] 

Feature 3: [Buttons, two buttons have been added into the app and provide the basic function of both clearing the EditText box and Entering the EditTExt box. once the enter button is clicked the app will display a meal suggestion. the clear button will clear the input typed into the EditText box, so the user is able to input another time of day] 

These features aim to provide a easy and simple flowing user experience. 

Design Considerations 

The design of the Meal Suggestion App was based on the following key considerations: 

User Experience: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience. 

Responsiveness: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility. 

Simplicity: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user. 

 

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization 

This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity. 

GitHub Actions: I utilized GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. This includes: 

Running automated tests to ensure the appâ€™s functionality. 

Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution. 

Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access. 

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

Challenges and Learnings 

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including: 

Challenge 1: [My First challenge was the lack of visual appeal. my app had no colour and no images. as this is the first time i have ever done something like this i was unsure of how to add images. After a quick youtube video and a bit of experimenting I was able to come up with my design, although basic I was impressed with how i figured it all out] 

challenge 2: [My main challenge with this project was my lack of understanding ho GitHub works, it was frustrating to navigate but after 2 tutor lessons and a couple of youtube videos and discussions with class mates I was able to execute what the project had required from me.]  

challenge 3: [Another challenge that I faced was dealing with error codes. I often didn't understand what the errors were so instead of simply hovering over It and reading the info and suggestions I rewrote my code 3 times into 3 different projects. These errors I soon came to realize were simple spelling and punctuation marks. rewriting the code caused issues later on when i had separate branches merging into different projects. fortunately I was able to force push these branches to successfully submit it to GitHub.] 

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions. 

Future Enhancements 

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are two features that could be added in the future, including: 

Feature 1: [Another Main activity file - I would have loved to add a second screen to my app to give it more character, and work on better designs and images, unfortunately I couldn't execute this] 

Feature 2: [For my predefined conditions i would have loved to implement a randomizer that randomly selects a meal suggestion from 3 options, unfortunately i could not execute this]
